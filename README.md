# Compilador-SableCC
Compiler built from scratch for abstract language

IDE used: Eclipse IDE

The project's proposal was to create a Compiler from scratch for a language called Cordel, with a different syntax, but based on the C Language.

The file Cordel (v4).pdf defines the characteristics of the language. All information about Lexicon, Syntactic, Abstract Syntactic and Semantic.
